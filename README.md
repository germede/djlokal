# djlokal

Uniting the local party scene, simplifying planning, fostering collaboration and enhancing experiences.

> Domain: `djlokal.de`

## Description

_djlokal_ is an emerging business that seeks to consolidate the local party scene.
Our company operates as a regional party platform, providing a centralized hub for event planners, local venues and DJs.
We aim to simplify the party planning process by offering a single platform that showcases upcoming events, available venues, and DJs based on their preferred genres.
Moreover, we facilitate communication between event planners and venues and we encourage feedback to enhance the overall party experience.
Our future plans involve expanding the platform to cover multiple regions and further centralize the party scene.

## Business activities

- **Centralize the local party scene**:
  Our organization is an upcoming regional party platform.
  Local venues and DJâ€™s should get the opportunity to introduce themselves into the party scene to get some traffic.
  While nowadays each club has itâ€™s own website and has to do researching for DJâ€™s and overlapping events we want to make this centralized on one certain platform.
  This platform should show any upcoming events, show venues where events could be planned and show DJâ€™s with their preferred genre so event planner can search for their prioritized options.

- **Enable communication of venues and people who want to do an event**:
  Venues should show if they can be accessible for a potential event so the event planner can contact them if they are interested.

- **Improve the party scene with feedback options**:
  We want to improve the scene while providing a feedback service to comment every event, venue, DJ or different constellations of the three parts.
  The feedback should show the event planner what they can do better.
  Venues should see if they can improve their setting or remove bad things.

- **Future work**:
  In the future we think about expanding this platform or create one for each region to centralize the party scene even more in one place or in each region.

## Project setup
### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Deploy to Firebase
After committing and pushing to GitHub, 
a build and deploy action will be triggered for the `dist` folder, 
so no manual `npm run build && firebase deploy` at the local machine is being required.

In order to reconfigure this automatic process when switching the repo, follow this guide: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration.
